A super easy way to automatically redirect a user to another page when viewing a post/page on your site.

== Description ==
Shortcode Redirect is a super easy plugin which allows site owners to automatically redirect a user after a chosen amount of seconds when viewing a page or post on the site. The plugin instructions are very simple. Add a shortcode to the post/page that looks like the following [redirect url='http://somesite.com' sec='3'] the url= part is where you define the URL to redirect the user to and the sec= part is where you define how many seconds to wait before redirecting.
